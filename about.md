## What's humanism?

Humanism is a worldview that holds people as capable of autonomous moral growth.
It seeks to make a world that is not only just, but equitable, for people regardless of age, race, gender, etc.
In action, humanism seeks human solutions for issues that affect human beings.
For further reading on the principles of international humanism, please read the Amsterdam Declaration.

## About the Asian Humanism Conference

The Asian Humanism Conference is a meeting of humanist youth in Asia.
It's goals are to help build connections between people and humanist organizations in the region as well as offer training on skills and capacity building to help make groups more effective in the work as humanists.
In recent years the Asian Humanism Conference has been held in Nepal, Singapore, and the Philippines as well as other nations.
This year, it will be held in Taiwan, the first time for the conference to be held in East Asia.

## About the Hosts

The conference's main sponsor is the International Humanists and Ethical Youth Organization(IHEYO), the youth branch of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU).
IHEYO is an umbrella organization that creates links between young humanists throughout the world.
The local hosts of the event are Taichung Atheists, Freethinkers, and Humanists and Taiwan Humanism Studio, and Ming-Jing Educational Association, three local humanist organizations in Taiwan.

## About the Theme

The theme for this year's conference is “Old and New: Timeless Solutions for Modern Challenges.”
We will be exploring humanism both as how it has been practiced in countries and places with strong humanist societies, and how we can learn from those groups and practices to expand humanism into new regions in the future.
Furthermore, we will try to combine the lesson of the past, with the best thinking of today to help us navigate through challenges that are both old and new.
